# Volunteeraro

Develop from January 2020 to June 2020 in Madrid, Spain.

## About:

Volunteeraro is a web page design for a voluntary association that organizes activities for children. The user of the web site can see the different services and events offered by the association, and all the volunteers that participates in the association. The user also has de possibility to register in the association, either to attend the activities or to participate as a volunteer and contact the association via messages.
