# Volunteeraro

Develop from January 2020 to June 2020 in Madrid, Spain.

## About:

Volunteeraro is a web page design for a voluntary association that organizes activities for children. The user of the web site can see the different services and events offered by the association, and all the volunteers that participates in the association. The user also has de possibility to register in the association, either to attend the activities or to participate as a volunteer and contact the association via messages. The web page consists of a fully responsive frontend together with a backend composed of a REST API using Swagger Editor, a Node.js server, and a PostgreSQL database to store all the data in web page. The full web page is avalible at the URL "https://volunteeraro.herokuapp.com/".

## Team:

This project was developed by one engineer, one designer and my self during the second semester of my year studing in the Politecnico di Milano, but done remotly from Spain due to Covid19.

## Development:

To design the Volunteeraro web page, first, we created a Design Document to make sure that all the group members had a clear idea of the project and the plan to develop it. The Design Document is accessible in the URL "https://volunteeraro.herokuapp.com/backend/designdocument.pdf". After creating the Design Document, we start with the development of the project. First, while some of the members of the group began developing the frontend, other started designing and creating the backend. First, we began designing the REST API using the Swagger Editor. Once we had the API completely designed, we began designing and creating the PostgreSQL database that host all the data of the page. Once we had the REST API and the database finished, we started to implement the backend server using Node.js, to allow the REST API to connect to the PostgreSQL database and retrieve information from it. The final REST API can be check in the documentation page available at the URL "https://volunteeraro.herokuapp.com/backend/swaggerui/". All of these, while the other part of the team focused on the frontend part, which was the most time demanding part of the project. When all the backend was completely ready and tested, the backend team joined the frontend team to help complete the frontend faster and bug fix it. Finally we also created a backend documentation to show all the work done, this documentation is available at the URL "https://volunteeraro.herokuapp.com/backend/main.html".
